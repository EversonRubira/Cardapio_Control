# CardápioControl 🍽️

**CardápioControl** is a simple web app to manage restaurant dishes. It was made for a college project. With this app, you can **view, add, remove, and search** for dishes. The interface uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The server uses Node.js to serve the static files.

## Features
- 📋 Show a list of dishes (Name, Type, and Price)
- ➕ Add new dishes
- ❌ Remove dishes
- 🔍 Search for dishes by name

## Technologies Used
- Node.js (server)
- HTML + CSS (interface)
- JavaScript (logic)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CardapioControl.git
   cd CardapioControl
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
3. Open in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   ```

## Folder Structure
```
📁 www/
 ├── index.html
 ├── scripts/
 │    └── script.js
 └── styles/
      └── style.css
app.js
```

## To Do (Future Ideas)
- Save dishes to a file (not just in memory)
- Add categories and filters (e.g., show only desserts)
- Create a real API to manage dishes
- Improve interface with more styles
- Add validation for price and dish type
